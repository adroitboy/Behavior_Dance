# Behavior_Dance

This is a interactiveÂ music project, the dancer triggers different sensors, there will be different music. In this project. Based on UDP, we use python3.5 to connect the hardware with the  Max7 music software. 

The "Switch_Redis.py" and "xAngle_Redis.py" are the switch sensor and angle sensor code. The "Socket_Redis.py" is the socket code, and then use the "packOSC.py" to send the sensor data to Max7.
